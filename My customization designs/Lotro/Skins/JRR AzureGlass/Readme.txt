Lotro update 21.2 introduced 2 new filter buttons on the quest log panel
This update consists only in a rebalancing of this panel to move properly these buttons at the bottom of the panel.
Thanks to Andvarion, ScottK and Osdor for taking me aware about this issue and about its solving from Siloren.
A special big thank to Siloren (software engineer in Standing Stones Games) for working and communicating about the panel code entries which made this fix possible.

- A few other minor improvements here and there.

- The skill banks switching buttons (sword/shield/horse) became 99% obsolete since Update 12, as it seems Turbine will never fix the "amnesic" shield bank.
This JRR Azure Glass update hides this function on custom toolbars (= all but "Universal"), this means you won't anymore click accidentally on it during a fight !
Please note that "1x1 BGM" toolbar has now its lotro store button located at the right.

- Fixed a minor display issue on the extended loot window (which was showing a bit more than 20 items).
- An icon has been added on locked travels on the stable master panel.
- warden class : I disabled the gambit combo name removal. This means now combo names will be displayed.
 
The combo name removal can be re-activated in skindefinition.xml by replacing this paragraph :

 <!-- Gambit combo name removal 
 <PanelFile ID="ID_UISkin_GamePlay_GambitBar">
 <Element ID="GamePlay_GambitBar" X="710" Y="591" Width="281" Height="118">
 <Element ID="GambitBar" X="0" Y="20" Width="281" Height="98">
 <Element ID="GambitWindow_GambitCashout_Name" X="0" Y="0" Width="1" Height="1"> </Element>
 </Element>
 </Element>
 </PanelFile>
 -->

with this one :

 <!-- Gambit combo name removal  -->
 <PanelFile ID="ID_UISkin_GamePlay_GambitBar">
 <Element ID="GamePlay_GambitBar" X="710" Y="591" Width="281" Height="118">
 <Element ID="GambitBar" X="0" Y="20" Width="281" Height="98">
